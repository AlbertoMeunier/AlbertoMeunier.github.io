Designed, built, and programmed the End-of-Arm Tooling (EOT) for a rover that transported rocks across a challenging 10,000 sqft competition field at NASA’s Johnson Space Center. Programmed the robot to execute complex multi-point movements with 98% accuracy, outperforming peers in robotic precision. EOT design increased material handling efficiency by 20%.
