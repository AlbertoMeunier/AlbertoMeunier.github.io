Developed a complex robotic system for Mars landings, utilizing JMARs for planetary mapping and OnShape for mechanical design, focusing on mitigating impact forces during Martian soil interaction. Modeled and simulated over 500 Martian soil conditions to ensure safe rover landing. Earned finalist status out of 900 students, which opened new doors for NASA collaborations.
