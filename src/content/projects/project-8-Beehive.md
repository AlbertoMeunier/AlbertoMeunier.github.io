Led the design and prototyping of an AI-driven beehive system, using sensor arrays to regulate hive entrances and detect diseases, addressing the global issue of colony collapse disorder. Successfully integrated AI decision-making algorithms to reduce pest infestation by 30% and improve hive health monitoring by 40%. Coordinated across international teams, leading to a prototype that could autonomously manage hive operations and environmental monitoring.
