Conceptualized and designed modular electromagnetic radiation shielding for space missions, including both spacecraft and astronaut protection from galactic cosmic rays. Successfully developed radiation shielding that reduced exposure by 25% for astronauts and sensitive satellite electronics, advancing safety protocols for deep-space exploration. Finalist in a prestigious NASA competition, leading to an undergraduate research internship at NASA.
