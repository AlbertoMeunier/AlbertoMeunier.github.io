Led a project to optimize the production of dental implants through SLA 3D printing and advanced CNC machining processes. Increased dental implant production throughput by 20% while maintaining a 99% precision rate in manufacturing. Reduced cycle times by implementing optimized machining strategies, improving the lab's profitability and output.
