Designed landing gear for drones tasked with surveying active volcanoes, with a focus on heat resistance, durability, and lightweight construction. Developed a landing gear system that withstood temperatures of up to 1,500°F, ensuring reliable drone operation in extreme volcanic environments. Optimized design reduced weight by 12%, allowing the drone to carry additional payloads while remaining within budget constraints.
