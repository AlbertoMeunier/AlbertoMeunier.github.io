Designed and simulated a rear wing mount for an IndyCar team, focusing on optimizing aerodynamic performance and structural strength. Achieved a 15% increase in downforce generation while reducing material usage by 10%, leading to improved on-track performance. The wing mountâ€™s structural integrity was tested and optimized for high-speed endurance, ensuring enhanced race safety and performance.
