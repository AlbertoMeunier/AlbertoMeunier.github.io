I am a passionate Materials Engineer with a strong focus on mechanical design, manufacturing, and materials science. My experience spans across various industries, including aerospace, automotive, and consumer products, where I have successfully led projects from concept to production. I specialize in using advanced tools like SolidWorks, ANSYS, and 3D printing technologies to develop innovative, efficient, and sustainable solutions.

My expertise lies in optimizing manufacturing processes, improving material performance, and integrating cutting-edge technologies into product designs. I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, constantly seeking new challenges that allow me to apply my skills in creative and impactful ways.

When I’m not engineering, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors, whether it’s running, climbing, or participating in drone racing. These activities keep me active and engaged, providing the perfect balance to my professional pursuits.

I am always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects that make a difference.
